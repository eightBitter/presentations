## SCRAP

It's an acronym which stands for...

- Spacing <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- Contrast <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Repetition <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Alignment <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Proximity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## CRAP Evolved

Robin Williams (the designer, not the actor) coined the acronym <b>CRAP</b> in her aptly-named book <i>The Non-Designer's Design Book</i> (now in its 4th edition)

## Spacing

Ensure that elements are not too close together (or too far apart). This includes sections of a page, graphical elements, characters, line spacing, etc. Spacing can be used to both group and separate different pieces of your layout. It can improve legibility, give your eyes a place to rest, and reduce (or increase) clutter / noise.

#HSLIDE

## Contrast

<blockquote>
The idea behind contrast is to avoid elements on the page that are merely <i>similar</i>. If the elements (type, color, size, line thickness, shape, space, etc.) are not the <i>same</i>, then make them <b>very different</b>. Contrast is often the most important visual attraction on a page--it's what makes a reader look at the page in the first place.

## Repetition

<blockquote>
Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. You can repeat colors, shapes, textures, spacial-relationships, line thicknesses, fonts, sizes, graphic concepts, etc. This develops the organization and strengthens the unity.

#HSLIDE

## Alignment

<blockquote>
Nothing should be placed on a page arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with another element on that page. This creates a clean, sophisticated, fresh look.

#HSLIDE

## Proximity

<blockquote>
Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps organize information, reduces clutter, and give the reader a clear structure.
