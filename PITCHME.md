## CRAP Evolved

Robin Williams (the designer, not the actor) coined the acronym <b>CRAP</b> in her aptly-named book <i>The Non-Designer's Design Book</i> (now in its 4th edition)

## Don't Make Me Think

You'll notice as we talk about of these basic design principles, that they all reduce the mental strain of the user.

Here is where I plug Steve Krug's fantastic book titled <i>Don't Make Me Think</i>. This book is a must-read if you're involved in any way with user interfaces.

## Spacing

Area around interface elements

- Usually have too little (visual suffocation)
- Used to both group and separate
- Affects legibility, noise, etc.
- Margin, padding, type spacing, line spacing, etc.

#HSLIDE

## Contrast

Difference between interface elements

- Most important visual attraction
- Avoid similar (subtly different) elements
- Different elements should be distinctly different
- Type, color, size, line thickness, shape, space, etc.

#HSLIDE

## Repetition

Consistency among interface elements

- Can occur in a page or across pages (sometimes across products)
- Creates feel of cohesion and unity
- Increases perceived credibility (purposeful)
- Colors, shapes, fonts, sizes, line thicknesses, locations, etc.

#HSLIDE

## Alignment

Connections between interface elements

- Never arbitrary
- Every element visually connected to another
- Creates a clean, sophisticated, fresh look
- Grids, rows, columns, borders, text, icons, etc.

#HSLIDE

## Proximity

Grouping related interface elements

- Multiple elements become one visual unit
- Organizes information and presents clear structure
- Increases perceived credibility (purposeful)
- Reduces noise
