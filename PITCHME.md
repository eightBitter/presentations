## CRAP Evolved

Robin Williams (the designer, not the actor) coined the acronym <b>CRAP</b> in her aptly-named book <i>The Non-Designer's Design Book</i> (now in its 4th edition)

## Don't Make Me Think

You'll notice as we talk about of these basic design principles, that they all reduce the mental strain of the user.

Here is where I plug Steve Krug's fantastic book titled <i>Don't Make Me Think</i>. This book is a must-read if you're involved in any way with user interfaces.

#HSLIDE

## Spacing

Area around interface elements

- Usually have too little (visual suffocation)
- Used to both group and separate
- Affects legibility, noise, etc.

#HSLIDE

## Spacing - Example

## Spacing - Elements

- Margin
- Padding
- Type (character) spacing
- Line spacing
- Etc.

#HSLIDE

## Contrast

Difference between interface elements

- Most important visual attraction
- Avoid similar (subtly different) elements
- Different elements should be very different

#HSLIDE

## Contrast - Example

![Constrast](images/CONTRAST.png)

#HSLIDE

## Contrast - Elements

- Color
- Type
- Size
- Line thickness
- Space
- Etc.


#HSLIDE

## Repetition

Consistency among interface elements

- Can occur in a page or across pages
- Can occur across products
- Creates feel of cohesion and unity
- Increases perceived credibility (purposeful)

#HSLIDE

## Repetition - Example

![Repetition](images/REPETITION.png)

## Repetition - Elements

- Colors
- Icons
- Shapes
- Fonts
- Sizes
- Spacing
- Locations
- Etc.

#HSLIDE

## Alignment

Connections between interface elements

- Never arbitrary
- Every element visually connected to another
- Creates a clean, sophisticated, fresh look

#HSLIDE

## Alignment - Example

![Alignment](images/ALIGNMENT.png)

http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/A_CRAP_way_to_improve_usability.html

## Alignment - Elements

- Grids
- Rows
- Columns
- Borders
- Text
- Icons
- Etc.

#HSLIDE

## Proximity

Grouping related interface elements

- Multiple elements become one visual unit
- Organizes information
- Presents clear structure
- Increases perceived credibility (purposeful)
- Reduces noise

#HSLIDE

## Proximity - Example

![Proximity](images/PROXIMITY.png)
